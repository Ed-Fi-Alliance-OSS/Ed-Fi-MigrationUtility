Directory contains a reference copy of scripts to build a new, empty Ed-Fi-ODS for each version.

**The scripts contained in this directory are NOT applied directly to the ODS during the upgrade process**

These scripts are currently used for the following
* Compute VersionLevel (based on script numbers/file name only)
* Executed directly by integration tests to validate schema and version level configuration

As of 7/26/2018:
These scripts are copied directly from the main Ed-Fi-ODS build (version specific branch).  A package is not yet available
See VersionLevelConfigurationTests for usage examples
